---> PEP 8:
	It is Python enhanced proposal.
	It says how a software developer has to create variables, how to give indentation (giving spaces) in python,how to declare functions,inorder to contribute in python community how your code must be.
	This is PEP 8.
	We have to write the code in PEP 8 format.
	PEP 8 is like a documentation which is available to the developers.
	It is set of rules / instructions that the code has to be written in.


------
Operators:

--> print (2+2)
	o/p : 4

--> print (3-2)
	o/p : 1

--> print (3*2)
	o/p : 6

--> print (3/2)
	o/p : 1.5

-->print (3//2)
	o/p : 1   ;If we want the value in integers we have to give //

--> print(3%2)
	o/p : 1

-->print (3>2)
	o/p : True

-->print(3<2)
	o/p : False

-->print(3==2)
	o/p: False

--> Walrus Operator: It allows to declare in print statement.
    Ex: print(a:=10)
	o/p : 10


--------
Q) Why we will use 'for' loop?
A) A 'for' loop is used to repeat a specific block of code a knowm number of times.



--> nums = [1,2,3,4]
    for i in range(len (nums)):
        print(nums[i])


Here, 'i' is the index.
We have used 'for' as we want to read every element and print.
'Range' is used to specify till what number the 'for' loop has to iterate.



--->Ex:
	nums = ["world","hello"]
	for i in range(0,1):
	    print(nums[i])

	o/p : world


Here,in range(0,1) ,
'0' is the Inclusve index.
'1' is the Exclusive index.
So it won't print nums[1]
